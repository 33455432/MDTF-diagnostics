- [ ] The html template has a 1-paragraph synopsis of the POD and links to the main documentation
- [ ] If applicable, I've added a .yml file to src/conda, and my environment builds with  
      conda_env_setup.sh 
- [ ] I have commented the code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation in the POD's doc/ subdirectory
- [ ] I have created the directory input_data/obs_data/[pod short name]
