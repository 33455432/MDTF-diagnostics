Example Diagnostic Documentation Example
========================================
Last update: 5/06/2020

This is an example document that you can use as a template for your diagnostics'
own documentation: it describes what information you should provide in each section. 
For example, if this were a real POD, you'd place a one-paragraph synopsis of 
your diagnostic here (like an abstract). It also serves as an example of the
RestructuredText (.rst) format.

.. Underline with '-'s to make a second-level heading.
